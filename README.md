MineOptim is a Minecraft server plugin that provides various performance optimizations and other useful features.

## Features

### PacketLimiter

The PacketLimiter feature provides a way to limit the number of packets sent between the server and clients. This can help reduce server lag caused by excessive packet traffic.

To use the PacketLimiter feature, simply enable it in the plugin configuration file. You can also adjust the packet limits and time intervals as needed to suit your server's needs.

The ArmourStandLimiter feature provides a way to limit the number of armor stands in each chunk of the world. This can help reduce server lag caused by excessive armor stand entities.
